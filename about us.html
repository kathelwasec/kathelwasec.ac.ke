        Igembe central in Meru County. Geographically it is located west of Nairobi

        population status. It is 5Km along Kangeta-Laare road and bare 10 minutes drive from both towns either.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;">It is sponsered by MCK in Kenya having started in 2006 initiated by community from the idea of microplanning
        unit where the first cash for starting the school had been primarily earmarked for society Sacco group.
        The enrolment was paltry 39 students on the onset and later the number grew to 73 when the first government Principal was 
        posted in the year <b>2008 (March)</b>.Since the school has expanded to the current status of a 3-streamed school. Teachers on duty are currently 22 TSC teachers and 6 BOM teachers and 13 Non-teaching members of staff 
        across all cadre.</p> 
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px">There is bright reflection of school Alumni where nearly every year the Boys and Girls who
        have done well in KCSE Exams have joined Tertiary Institutions with the performance distributed from
        2009 to date.The school infrastructure has also been expansive from the first class. Currently the institution is managed
        by a vibrant BOM under the able leadership of Mr. George Ntombiro Miriti who took over from the year 
        2019 to the date of this Web Launch.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px">The PA chair is Madam Rose Ntongai who is very committed and mindful of the wellness of the learners.
        Finally the sponsor(MCK) has played a very positive role in nurturing spiritual talents.
        Special thanks goes to the futive sister school Kathelwa Primary School, the futive Kathelwa community
        leaders led by Chief Joshua K. Gideon and his Assistant Peter Gitonga, former MCAs and MPs and most 
        withstanding Hon Daniel Kiili Karitho who has really boosted the school image by awarding bursary to
        students in a very unique way and above that promising to have a school Bus funded by NG-CDF during
        his first term in office.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;">The good teachers, students, parents, non-teaching staff, BOM members, PTA and the entire well wishers
        fraternity, you are all highly valued by us.
