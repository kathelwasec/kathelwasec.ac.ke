<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The Teachers Induction, Mentorship and Coaching Program has been established to 
complement other professional development initiatives such as the internship program,
 school support programs and those related to skills development in the teaching service.
  Mentorship and Coaching takes place when an experienced teacher or expert assists a teacher
   to grow in all spheres of their life as a professional. The program is in line with the 
   Teachers Service Commission’s reform agenda and adoption of best practices in career development,
    professional conduct and performance management for efficient service delivery in the teaching service. 
    The program is informed by the need to engage on preventive strategies and a corrective approach in the
     management of teacher professional conduct and performance. The mentor facilitates career and psycho-social
      development of a mentee by providing required professional support which will help to prevent occurrence of
       professional misconduct. This will result in improved performance in the teaching service leading to 
       overall improved learning outcomes. The Mentorship and Coaching program will help the teacher to make 
       more informed decisions in their professional practice and personal lives, while also providing a full 
       opportunity for them to access an exciting and fulfilling career. It is envisaged that the Mentorship 
       and Coaching program will influence employee retention by helping to establish a life-long learning culture 
       that is attractive to top talent who desire growth opportunities in the teaching profession. This Policy
        Framework will provide clear guidance in institutionalizing the mentorship and coaching program in the 
        teaching service.</p>
